The implemented minimization function from part A is used to investigate the Higgs boson
The Breit-Wigner function is fitted, by minimizing the fit function
x0=       120          3          6 
The initial guess is (120, 3, 6)
From the algoritm:

	Mass = 125.976448860377
	Width = -1.78656664189583
	Amplitude = 850.29279848006
