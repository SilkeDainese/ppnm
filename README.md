## EXAM PROJECT: # 2: Akima (sub)spline
My student number end in 54. So my exam project is number 2 (54 % 26 = 2). In this project I have implemented the Akima (sub-)spline interpolation. I have followed the procedure in our book "Yet Another Introduction to Numerical Methods" version June 16, 2023, D.V. Fedorov.

## Grading
I would rate my exam project at 7 out of 10. I successfully implemented an Akima (sub-)spline routine and thoroughly tested it using random data, demonstrating its applicability to a wide range of datasets. I designed the routine to be both elegant and easily understandable.

The core functionality of my routine involves taking a set of data points (x, y), which might be noisy or unevenly distributed. I then subdivided the dataset into smaller segments and constructed individual cubic sub-splines for each of these segments. The key feature is the flexibility to manually adjust the spacing of the interpolation, allowing for tailored results.

Throughout the process, I diligently calculated the Akima coefficients, weights, and slopes for each sub-spline. These calculations contributed to forming a coherent and smooth piecewise continuous curve that closely approximated the original data points.

I didn't stop at the implementation; I took it a step further by creating visual representations of the results. Specifically, I generated plots of the resulting Akima sub-spline curve. This visualization effectively conveyed the success of my interpolation method, showcasing the smooth transition between the random data points.

In summary, my project demonstrated a well-executed implementation of the Akima (sub-)spline routine. I showcased its versatility by testing it on random data, and I took care to make the code elegant and easy to understand. The visualizations provided tangible evidence of the success of the interpolation, thereby achieving a solid overall rating of 7 out of 10.
